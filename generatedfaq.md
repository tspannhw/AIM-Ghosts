Milvus and Unstructured Data: An FAQ

1. What is unstructured data and why is it a challenge?

Unstructured data is any data that doesn't fit neatly into a predefined data model, such as tables with rows and columns. This includes text, images, videos, audio files, and more. The challenge lies in the difficulty of analyzing and extracting meaningful insights from such diverse and often complex data formats. Traditional databases are not well-equipped to handle unstructured data, making it difficult to leverage for AI applications.

2. What are vector embeddings and how do they address the unstructured data challenge?

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of data points in a multi-dimensional space. They are created using machine learning models, such as neural networks, which learn to map the semantic meaning of data into a numerical vector. These vectors capture the relationships between data points based on their content and meaning. By converting unstructured data into vector embeddings, we can apply AI algorithms to analyze and extract insights.

3. What is a vector database and how does it differ from traditional databases?

A vector database is specifically designed to store, index, and query vector embeddings generated from unstructured data. Unlike traditional databases, vector databases utilize specialized indexing techniques and similarity search algorithms to efficiently retrieve relevant information based on the semantic meaning of the data.

4. What is Milvus and what are its key features?

Milvus is an open-source vector database built to manage and utilize massive numbers of embeddings generated by deep neural networks and large language models (LLMs). It offers:

Scalability and elasticity: It can handle billions of vectors and scale to accommodate growing data volumes.
Diverse index support: Milvus supports a wide range of indexing types optimized for different use cases, balancing search speed and accuracy.
Versatile search capabilities: It provides various search methods, including approximate nearest neighbor search, hybrid search, and multi-vector search.
Hardware acceleration: Milvus supports GPU and FPGA acceleration for enhanced query performance.
Multiple deployment options: It is available as Milvus Lite (for resource-constrained environments), Milvus Standalone (for single-node deployments), and Milvus Distributed (for large-scale distributed deployments).
5. How does similarity search work with vector embeddings?

Similarity search involves finding data points whose embeddings are close to each other in the vector space, indicating semantic similarity. It works by:

Transforming unstructured data into vectors using an embedding model.
Storing these vectors in a vector database like Milvus.
Performing a query by providing an embedding of a search term.
Using approximate nearest neighbor search to find the most similar vectors in the database.
Returning the corresponding data points as search results.
6. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and how is it used with vector databases?

RAG combines the strength of retrieval-based and generative models, like LLMs. It works by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base using similarity search in a vector database and then using this information to enhance the accuracy and relevance of LLM responses.

7. What are some common use cases for Milvus?

Milvus is ideal for applications that rely on semantic understanding of unstructured data, such as:

Semantic search: Powering search engines that understand the meaning behind search queries and deliver more relevant results.
Recommendation systems: Building recommendation engines that personalize suggestions based on user preferences and item similarity.
Image and video analysis: Analyzing images and videos to identify objects, scenes, and patterns.
Natural Language Processing: Enhancing tasks like question answering, text summarization, and sentiment analysis with relevant context retrieval.
